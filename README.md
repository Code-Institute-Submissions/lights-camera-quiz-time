### Design

#### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme](assets/images/movie-quiz-palette.png)
The main colors used are Rosy Brown, Copper, Auburn, Seal brown and Raw umber. The color scheme was chosen by uploading the popcorn image to the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website and choosing a selection of the colors identified in the popcorn image.

#### Typography
I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) to choose a pairing of the fonts. I choose Work Sans 300 for headings and Cormorant Infant 300 for the body. I used [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the import link. I used sans-serif as the back-up text font for accessibility.

The popcorn image was sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) [Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-snack-popcorn-movie-theater-33129/).
