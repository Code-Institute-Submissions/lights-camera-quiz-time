### Design

#### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme](assets/images/movie-quiz-palette.png)
The main colors used are Rosy Brown, Copper, Auburn, Seal brown and Raw umber. The color scheme was chosen by uploading the popcorn image to the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website and choosing a selection of the colors identified in the popcorn image.

#### Typography
I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) to choose a pairing of the fonts. I choose Work Sans 300 for headings and Cormorant Infant 300 for the body. I used [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the import link. I used sans-serif as the back-up text font for accessibility.

#### Imagery
The popcorn image was sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) [Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-snack-popcorn-movie-theater-33129/).

The addition of the green and red background colors for correct and incorrect selected answers provides the user with a visual stimulus and indication of their progress with the quiz.

The heads up display includes the question the user is currently on and displays the score to the user. The score implements when a user gets a correct answer which is also signified by the temporary green background color which display on the answer box selected. This provides value to the user as it is clear the number of questions they have completed and whether they were successful in answering the questions in the chosen category.

When the user completes the max number of questions they are navigated to the end screen where their score is displayed. The user has the option to complete the form input with their name and save their result or they have the option to return to the home screen and choose another category. If the user chooses to save their score they are then naviagted to a high scores screen where the top 5 high scores are displayed. This provides value to the user as they have the option to save their score if they are happy with their result and encourages competition amongst users to achieve the highest possible score.
