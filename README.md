### Design

#### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme](assets/images/movie-quiz-palette.png)
The main colors used are Rosy Brown, Copper, Auburn, Seal brown and Raw umber. The color scheme was chosen by uploading the popcorn image to the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website and choosing a selection of the colors identified in the popcorn image.

#### Typography
I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) to choose a pairing of the fonts. I choose Work Sans 300 for headings and Cormorant Infant 300 for the body. I used [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the import link. I used sans-serif as the back-up text font for accessibility.

#### Imagery
The popcorn image was sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) [Image Source](https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-snack-popcorn-movie-theater-33129/).

### Existing Features
- ![Heading](assets/images/heading.png)
The heading displays the title of the movie quiz to the user and has an anchor embedded that when clicked the user returns to the home screen. This provides value to the user as the user can return to the home page with ease from any of the screens.
- ![Category Buttons](assets/images/categories-buttons.png)
There are siz categories for the user to choose from. This provides value to the user as many different genres of film are included for the user to choose from. Each of the buttons has a transition hover effect that evokes a positive visual response from the user.
- ![Footer](assets/images/footer-icons.png)
There are links to social media sites for the user to interact with. The links open in an external tab which removes the necessity to click the back button. The inclusion of this feature provides value to the user as they can access the author's social media page to gain insight into the author and confirm the site is a credible and reliable source.
- ![Game Section](assets/images/game-area.png)
Once the user choses a category they are navigated to the game screen where there is a question and 4 possible options displated to the user. This provides value as the user has options to aid them in answering the question. The addition of the green and red background colors for correct and incorrect selected answers provides the user with a visual stimulus and indication of their progress with the quiz.
- ![Heads-Up-Display](assets/images/heads-up-display.png)
The heads up display includes the question the user is currently on and displays the score to the user. The score implements when a user gets a correct answer which is also signified by the temporary green background color which display on the answer box selected. This provides value to the user as it is clear the number of questions they have completed and whether they were successful in answering the questions in the chosen category.
- ![End Screen with Form](assets/images/end-screen.png)
When the user completes the max number of questions they are navigated to the end screen where their score is displayed. The user has the option to complete the form input with their name and save their result or they have the option to return to the home screen and choose another category. If the user chooses to save their score they are then naviagted to a high scores screen where the top 5 high scores are displayed. This provides value to the user as they have the option to save their score if they are happy with their result and encourages competition amongst users to achieve the highest possible score.
- ![High scores screen](assets/images/high-scores-screen.png)
The high scores screen displays the top 5 results including the score and the user who achieved the score. The current user can view the results and determine if they have been successful to reach the high scores board. There is also a home button where the user can return to the categories home screen. This screen provides value as it gives a sense of achievement to users.

### Bugs
#### Solved Bugs
- ![JSON file not loading](assets/images/json-import-bug.png)
The import method was used at the top of the js file to import the quiz questions from the json file ![import code](assets/images/json-import-code.png). This code caused the home screen, game screen and end screens to all display at once when the site loaded. The following error displayed on the console ![Import method console error](assets/images/json-import-console-error.png). To rectify this error I used the fetch() method to import the quiz questions from the json file and this solved the bug and the screens displayed as expected.
- ![If statement for when a user completes the max questions](assets/images/error-max-questions-if-statement.png)
Initally when setting the if statement for what happens when the user completed the max number of questions I had set a condition as when the max questions are greater than or equal to 5 and this caused the screen to load and re load continuously without stopping. I realised that I needed to write the condition as it the question counter constant was greater than or equal to 5. Using the max questions this condition would be met before any question loaded as the max questions was set to a constant of 5.
- ![The most recent score displaying for the current score](assets/images/recent-score-bug.png)
When a user completes the quiz their score incrememnts correctly in the heads up display however when they are navigated to the end screen where their score is displayed the most recent score displayed is the previous score instead of their most recent score. The initial code used was ![Code to display most recent score on end page](assets/images/recent-score-code.png). I changed the .textContent to equal score instead of mostRecentScore which fixed the bug for the current user.
- ![High Scores not displaying](assets/images/display-high-scores-bug.png)
When a user achieved a high score in the console the user and their score was being logged however it was not being displayed to the user on the high score screen until another game was played and the high score screen was accessed again. ![The code used to display the high score](assets/images/display-high-scores-code.png) The code used to display the highscores was written below the saveHighScores function. I realised this was being carried out after the function so I included the code inside the saveHighScores function and this solved the issue ![Display high scores fix](assets/images/display-high-score-fix.png).
- ![Quiz questions not displaying as json file not fully loaded](assets/images/question-not-loading.png)
When the available questions varibable is set to the scifiquestions property from the json file it takes time to fetch the questions and if the user clicks the scifi category before the DOM fully loads the questions do not display. ![Code used to fetch the questions from the json file](assets/images/json-fetch-code.png). After realising the issue is that the user can click the scifi button before the questions are being fetched from the json file I decided to remove the code and place it inside the function that executes once the DOM has fully loaded and this fixed the issue.

#### Unsolved Bugs
- I have assigned the questions to variables in the js file. I also have the questions included in a json file and I am accessing the properties of the json file for the scifiquestions category. My mentor recommended to me that in reality data such as questions and their options for quizes are stored in json filed and then accessed in other files such as js files. The syntax I have used is correct for writing json and the scifiquestions are displaying to the user. I have left the other categories as accessing the data from the variables as I am concerned more bugs may appear as I am new to using json.
